# Meta Conversion API Tag for Google Tag Manager(server-side)

The Meta Conversions API Tag allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Conversions API.

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema that’s sent from the client running on a tagging server. It then converts events to the appropriate schema and sends them through Conversions API. It also allows to send a response to the browser that will trigger a call to the Meta Pixel. This allows to remove the Facebook SDK on the browser side and thus gain in web performance.

The Tag supports only GA4 clients.
